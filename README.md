Install development dependencies:

```
npm install
```
Development tasks automatically rebuild certain parts of the library when files are changed (`start` – wavesurfer, `start:plugins` – plugins). Start a dev task and go to `localhost:8080/example/` to test the current build.

Start development server for core library:

```
npm run start
```

Start development server for plugins:

```
npm run start:plugins
```

Build all the files. (generated files are placed in the `dist` directory.)

```
npm run build
```

Running tests only:

```
npm run test
```

Build documentation with esdoc (generated files are placed in the `doc` directory.)
```
npm run doc
```

If you want to use [the VS Code - Debugger for Chrome](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug), there is already a [launch.json](.vscode/launch.json) with a properly configured ``sourceMapPathOverrides`` for you.
